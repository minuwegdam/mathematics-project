// Example PHP code for exploring mathematical concepts through coding
// Here we'll play with some basic arithmetic and algebraic expressions

// Adding 2 to 3
echo "2 + 3 = " . (2 + 3) . "<br>";

// Subtracting 5 from 8
echo "8 - 5 = " . (8 - 5) . "<br>";

// Multiplying 4 by 6
echo "4 * 6 = " . (4 * 6) . "<br>";

// Dividing 12 by 3
echo "12 / 3 = " . (12 / 3) . "<br>";

// Adding 7 to 9 and dividing the result by 2
echo "7 + 9 = " . ((7 + 9) / 2) . "<br>";

// Subtracting 4 from 6, then multiplying the result by 5
echo "6 - 4 * 5 = " . (((6 - 4) * 5)) . "<br>";
?>
